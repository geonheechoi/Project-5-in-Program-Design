Problem 1 â€“ Multiple of 11 Checking if a number X is a multiple of another number Y is easy when it is small enough to be stored in a variable of integer type (e.g., int, long int). We just have to check if the remainder of the division of X by Y is zero (i.e., X%Y == 0). However, when the number is too large, this can be a tricky task. Luckily, when dealing with multiples of 11 (Y=11), there is another way of performing this check: if the difference of the sum of the digits at odd places and even places of X is 0 or a multiple of 11, then X is a multiple of 11 as well.
